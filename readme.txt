steps to run project:


download the project from GIT to your local system.
Unzip the ".war" and copy all file from "Webcontent/WEBINF/lib" to "Webcontent/WEBINF/lib" folder of the project.


please run the sql script file from "DBScripts" folder.

DB crediationals 
user : root
pwd :""


Note: since I had very less time and due some personal problem following things are not taken care.

1) The DB crediationals are Hardcoded inside java instead of specifing in web.xml.
2) Logging is not done.
3) Styling of view is not taken care.
4) less validation is done.
